The analysis report on gerrymandering doesnâ€™t support the idea of what gerrymandering stands for. Gerrymandering claims to be the process of redrawing legislative
boundaries in order to benefit the party in power. These boundaries are redrawn periodically to make sure that each district has approximately the same population. After
browsing through the data of Florida, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. We zeroed in on the voting results from the 2018 election in Minnesota which has 37% of the republican seats whereas the democrats make up 62% of the seats.  
Concluding the data from Minnesota, it is clear to see that gerrymandering can do more harm than good in swing states. Regardless of which political party
benefits from the gerrymandering procedures, by changing the boundaries of the counties they can sway the political climate of the area. Politics should accurately represent every voter as an individual, and after looking through the data of Minnesota it clearly
states the discriminatory boundaries that are created from gerrymandering.
